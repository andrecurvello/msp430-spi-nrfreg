SPI example for MSP430 using mps430-gcc on Linux

Introduction
------------

This example shows how to use SPI on USCI_B of the MSP430g2553 to communicate to a Nordic NRF24l01+ module. It simply reads out the configuration register of the NRF and prints out the result in binary on the UART at USCI_A at 9600 bauds. 

Hardware Setup
--------------

The wiring for this example is as follows:

MSP430					To
----------------------------------------
RXD  P1.1				TXD serial line
TXD	P1.2				RXD serial line
SCLK P1.5				NRF SCK	
SOMI P1.6				NRF MO
SIMO P1.7				NRF MI
CS   P1.3				NRF CS

For the NRF also connect the following:

NRF						To
----------------------------------------
VCC						3.3v
CE						3.3v
GND						GND
 
NOTE: When using the TI Launchpad, "/dev/ttyACM0" could be used as serial port at 9600 Bauds, but RX/TX must be crossed on the jumper bridge of the Launchpad.


Compilation
------------

This project is written for msp430-gcc on Linux (I used v4.5.3 which is available as package on Ubuntu). For flashing the "mspdebug" tool was used (also from the Ubuntu package).

To compile the source just issue a:

make

This builds the firmware in the "bin" subdirectory in various formats.


Flashing
------------

To flash the firmware to your Launchpad through "mspdebug", you could use the "flash-target" make target:

make flash-target


Doxygen Docs
------------

If you installed doxygen on your system, you could generate the HTML-based documentation by calling:

make gen-docs

This will create the documentation under "doc/gen/html".


Usage
------------

Connecting your Launchpad should give you a new serial device "/dev/ttyACM0". Connect to this port at 9600 bauds - e.g. by using screen:

screen /dev/ttyACM0 9600

After resetting the Launchpad, the configuration register of the NRF should be printed out on the serial line.
